Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a customer will stay or churn using machine learning models. The application allows users to input key customer data and receive a prediction based on a trained model. It is built with Python and integrates machine learning tools and techniques to analyze customer behavior and predict retention outcomes.

Key Features:
Customer Data Input: Input fields for customer-related data such as usage frequency, support calls, payment delays, contract length, and more.
Churn Prediction: Based on the input data, the machine learning model predicts whether a customer is likely to stay or churn.
Streamlit App: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction with the model.
Model Integration: Uses various machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate churn prediction models.
MLflow: Integrated with MLflow for tracking model training and performance.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core language for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas, Scikit-learn: For data manipulation and building machine learning models.
Streamlit: Used to build the web interface for users to interact with the model.
MLflow: For tracking model metrics and parameters during development.
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install the necessary Python dependencies using the requirements file.
Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
Input customer data and get a prediction on whether the customer will churn or stay.
Future Enhancements:
Improve the model with additional customer data features.
Explore other algorithms for better prediction accuracy.
Enhance the UI for a more seamless user experience.
